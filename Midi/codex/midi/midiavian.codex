    "Avians are a mixed bag for me. On the one hand, I like people with beaks. Reminds me of the gryphons back home. You could almost say these Avians are half-gryphon... and the other half is just missing. Their beliefs, however...", "Look, I'm not against religion. I'm a metaversalist myself. I've also seen people in our own reality with immense, land-shaping psychic and/or magic power, and creatures made of energy. Stick them together, and you basically have a god, right? The science birds think that losing wings should have taken millions of years, but that's assuming it happened by evolution, right? But that's not what the Avians believe.", "They're not saying the wings disappeared naturally; they're saying they were taken, and it makes sense to me. If a being of such great power wanted to punish someone, couldn't he just cause a mutation in them that made them rapidly lose their wings? If the Apex can make someone mutate within a matter of days, why can't a creature capable of controlling energy with their mind?", "So what bothers me about them? It's the practices. Ritual sacrifices of people, conquest, even having a verse in their holy book saying followers of Kluex are just better than others.\n\nThis Tonouac guy seems pretty nice, even big and cuddly, but he's so cheerful about the other stuff that it comes off as kinda creepy. I wanna like him, but things like that are hard to ignore. At least his beak wastes no time getting to the point."
