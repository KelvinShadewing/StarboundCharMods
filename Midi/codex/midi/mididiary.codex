    "I was on the planet Earth, having jumped through my latest warp zone to a world with technology I'd never even dreamed of. Seriously, the stuff there could replace magic. They told me I'd be able to earn my own ship if I went through the Protectorate's training course, so I took it. Today, on the day of my graduation, everything went south. So south that if space had directions, it would go space's south.", "These giant tentacles burst out of the ground and started dragging people under, wrapping around buildings and pulling them underground, too. No one ever mentioned a giant calamari monster living underground, but there it was. The entire city went under. I didn't even see any survivors on the way to the launch pad, and I knew I wouldn't have time to get into the city and find people to bring with me, but that doesn't make me feel any better for leaving them behind.", "One of the tentacles hit the ship and damaged it. The impact also hit me pretty hard; my transphere is damaged, my aura feels weak, and I can't even seem to reach my other bomb spells. It's like that thing just sucked the magic out of me. Now I'm stuck in space. The ship seems to have an AI running it, so at least I don't have to worry about going it alone entirely. Too bad the ship was badly damaged, and the FTL drive leaked all its fuel, so I can't leave the system I'm floating in. Ouya.", "There was a radio transmission earlier that was fuzzy, but mentioned some survivors headed to an outpost at a place called the Ark. They said to look for gates on planets that had been settled by the ancients, as they would have a direct link to the Ark. I hope they're right. Maybe someone on this outpost can help me repair my transphere, too. In the meantime, I just gotta fix this ship and survive.", "There's a planet down below me. Lopers willing, there'll be one of those gates down there. Here I go. Plair guide me."
