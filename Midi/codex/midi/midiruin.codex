    "Waaaait, how come the Novakids didn't get a relic? There's even a picture of them on the gate! What, did the ancients just never get around to making one for them or something?", "Anywho, that ob-Nox-ious woman showed up again. I gotta be honest... I'm a little jealous of her ball form. Mine can't jump around and be all crazy like hers. As for the ruin itself, the fight was a little weird. It kept summoning creatures to help instead of just fighting me head-on. It almost seemed desperate.", "And then came the epic escape sequence!... Or there would have been if the Ruin hadn't been a smart son of a... whatever eldritch monsters come from, and locked the doors so I couldn't get out! And then I died!", "No, really, I died. Next thing I knew, I woke up to this giant dude dropping me off at the Ark. He had a look like he'd just gotten done saying something epic, but I was kinda too dead to hear it. Probably doesn't matter.", "Now that my quest here is over, I can get back to searching for Kyroda. It's a big galaxy, so I could be at this for a while, but at least I'm not jumping through random warp zones anymore, so I can leave a planet whenever I want to. That should speed things up, right?", "Oh, hold on, now that weird cloaked dude wants to sell me keys to those other ancient gates. *sigh* Fine. Might as well check those out. Anywho, time to get moving. Going on a trip in my only rocket ship.", "Thanks for playing through this mod!
