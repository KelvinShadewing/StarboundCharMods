## Characters

* __**Midi Waffle**__

  Midi is a kholu from Kyrodian Legends. He includes craftable nut bombs that cost pixels, core fragments, and elemental ingredients to create, and can be made without a crafting station.
  
  To play as him, install a race selection extender mod and click his face in the character creation. Set gender to male, and click the arrow next to Personality until his full body appears. (changing the graphics of every pose to his body also changes pivot positions for the arms.)
  
  Midi will start equipped with his jacket and pants, and his hat and tail can be found in the ship locker. These items will hide any equipment he wears, since his sprite does not fit the mold of traditional Starbound sprites.
  
  He also has his transphere tech, which currently cam only be unlocked using admin commands. To unlock them, enter these commands:
  
  ```
  /admin
  /maketechavailable transphere
  /enabletech transphere
  /admin
  ```
  
  The tech will be available to select from the tech console at the outpost. The transphere moves much faster than the distortion sphere and can jump higher. The ability to lay time bombs will be added in the future.
  
  Midi's nut bombs currently come in eight varieties:
  
  * **One-Handed:**
    
    * *Acorn Bomb* - Normal explosive attack. Does minimal damage and has short range.
    
    * *Fire Acorn* - Adds burning damage.
    
    * *Ice Acorn* - Adds freezing damage.
    
    * *Thunder Acorn* - Adds shocking damage.
    
  * **Two-Handed:**
  
    * *Nutshot* - Creates two simultaneous bombs, one exploding locally to launch the other forward. The launched bomb adds knockback to the damage. Costs double energy.
    
    * *Fire Nutshot* - Adds burning damage.
    
    * *Ice Nutshot* - Adds freezing damage.
    
    * *Thunder Nutshot* - Adds shocking damage.
  
  All of Midi's explosives are harmless to friendly units (with the exception of Froggs due to their programming, but llama and mushroom people remain unaffected).

  * **TODO:**
  
    * Add unique explosion sprites.
    
    * Add explosion to Midi's hand when firing Nutshot.
    
    * Find a way to change arm pivot positions.
    
    * Add scanner lore.
    
    * Make it so that when not firing, Midi's arms use the unarmed animation, and make the throwing animation actually look like throwing.
    
    * Have transphere tech active at start.
    
    * Create tech station graphics.
    
    * Find/make a new ship.
    
  * **NOTES:**
  
    * The titaniumbar recipe was put into the species config because it didn't show up while playing as him for some reason.
    
    * Midi's slow walk animation is broken because Starbound reverses the arm frame instead of using eight frames. I'm really not a fan of this, because I can think of other things that would be make impossible by animating like this.
