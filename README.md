## Characters

* __**Midi Waffle**__

  Midi is a kholu from Kyrodian Legends. He includes craftable nut bombs that only cost pixels to create, and can be made without a crafting station. He also has his transphere tech, which currently can only be unlocked using admin commands. To unlock them, enter these commands:
  
  ```/admin
  /maketechavailable transphere
  /enabletech transphere
  /admin```
  
  The tech will be available to select from the tech console at the outpost. The transphere moves much faster than the distortion sphere and can jump higher. The ability to lay time bombs will be added in the future.
  
  Midi's nut bombs currently come in eight varieties:
  
  * **One-Handed:**
    
    * *Acorn Bomb* - Normal explosive attack. Does minimal damage and has short range.
    
    * *Fire Acorn* - Adds burning damage.
    
    * *Ice Acorn* - Adds freezing damage.
    
    * *Thunder Acorn* - Adds shocking damage.
    
  * **Two-Handed:**
  
    * *Nutshot* - Creates two simultaneous bombs, one exploding locally to launch the other forward. The launched bomb adds knockback to the damage. Costs double energy.
    
    * *Fire Nutshot* - Adds burning damage.
    
    * *Ice Nutshot* - Adds freezing damage.
    
    * *Thunder Nutshot* - Adds shocking damage.
  
  All of Midi's explosives are harmless to friendly units (with the exception of Froggs due to their programming, but llama and mushroom people remain unaffected).

  * **TODO:**
  
    * Add unique explosion sprites.
    
    * Finish Midi's body sprites.
    
    * Find a way to change arm pivot positions.
    
    * Add scanner lore.
    
    * Replace all instances of "sktest" with "midi" (the replacement batch file that came with the template only corrupted files by filling them with `{sktest=midi`).
